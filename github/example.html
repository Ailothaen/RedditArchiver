I think you can find some good videos quite easily. While watching that video look at the night time of the earth. What you'll see is that the night face of earth is facing different parts of the Galaxy at different times of the year. This is where things like horoscope come from in identifying constellations at different times of the year. Anyway the Galaxy is huge and all the stars are spinning in it. So the position of the various stars will be pretty much the same at a given time of the year. </p></p><p><p>Now look at a model of just the solar system with the sun and all its planets. Pay attention to the position of the planets relative to the night face of earth. Since all the planets are orbiting the sun along their own orbit what is observed from the night face of the earth will vary a lot. Their position between years will change. Sometimes they'll move faster than the other stars sometimes slower or start going in reverse relative to the other stars over days. Because of this planets were identified as special. The word planet means to wander.</p></p><p><p>Copernicus posited the heliocentric model as an explanation for the weird motion of the planets. And that is how planets were identified as other planets orbiting the same sun as earth rather than everything orbiting Earth.</p></p><p><p>Copernicus wasn't completely correct because he didn't say the sun had its own orbit. But this is a relatively recent understanding that was developed.</p></p><p><p>Also stars were observed a lot. Go to a dark skies preserve to see just how visible they are. Everyone got to experience brighter stars than that every day of their life. They were used for navigation for ages. So data and knowledge about their motion has existed for a very long time</p><div class="o l3" id="t1_ipp8erx"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/marcher138">marcher138</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/xm9kun/eli5_how_did_the_people_hundreds_of_years_ago/ipp8erx/">Sat 2022-09-24 at 09:59</a> (1) <a href="#t1_ipomti7" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#" class="n A D">🠉</a> <a href="#" class="n B D">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_ipp8erx" class="n S">◯</a></header><p>Fantastic summary! To continue on because I love this part of history and could talk about it for hours, the common belief before Copernicus was that the planets moved in circles around the Earth, and retrograde (backwards) motion was explained by epicycles: a small circular orbit along the main orbit. Basically, the planets moved in spirals around the Earth. But, as observations got more precise, astronomers had to add more and more epicycles just to make the model match the observation (planets orbited in a circle while orbiting in a circle while orbiting in a circle while...). Copernicus determined that a heliocentric system better matched observations without so many epicycles.</p></p><p><p>BUT, Copernicus' model also required epicycles! Just not as many. That's because he still subscribed to the classical belief that all orbits must be circular, because planets rested on spheres of aether. Brahe disproved that through observation of a comet passing through those spheres, and proposed a hybrid model where the planets revolved around the Sun, but the Sun revolved around the Earth (still in circles). It wasn't until Kepler (Brahe's student) proposed elliptical orbits in a heliocentric model that epicycles were finally shown the door.</p><div class="e l4" id="t1_ippaibo"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/Fragrag">Fragrag</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/xm9kun/eli5_how_did_the_people_hundreds_of_years_ago/ippaibo/">Sat 2022-09-24 at 10:30</a> (1) <a href="#t1_ipp8erx" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#" class="n A D">🠉</a> <a href="#" class="n B D">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_ippaibo" class="n S">◯</a></header><p>Tycho Brahe's model is absolutely insane when you look at a video of it.

But as far as they know,1800 BC the Babylonians were already maintaining daily, monthly, and yearly records of the perceived motion of the sun and moon, and other celestial bodies. Pythagoras of Greece, born around 570 BC,mathematically determined the world was round, and realized so were most other celestial bodies. Eratosthenes of Greece (sp?) used math to calculate the circumference of Earth, the tilt of the axis, and even thought up leap days. He was born around 276 BC. Aryabhata of India,born maybe 476 AD, figured out eclipses, figured out the moon reflected the light of the sun, the value of pi to four places, all kinds of mathematics that I need ELI5. Mayan calendar, Egyptian calendar very like the one we use now; look up Nabta Playa, it’s really cool! (A lot of what I’m typing involves a battle with the bloody auto correct!!) Gan De, Chinese astronomer about four centuries before Christ, created the Star Catalogue of Sho. Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi born 903 AD, discovered the Andromeda galaxy. Abu Mahmud Hamid ibn al-Kidhr al-Khojandi built an enormous mural sextant and figured out the axial tilt so well he even noted that it was decreasing.

I don't know all the history but let's skip to the part where someone has a telescope for looking out into the coast waters and spotting possible enemy ships or trade ships. One day the moon is big and bright and that person goes "Well fuck let me look at this mf with this thing he'll yeah brother" and even with a very weak telescope you can see tons of detail in the moon. Try it if you haven't.</p></p><p><p>So at the same time people were also just looking at the stars and noticing that some of them were always in the same spot, some were just very so slightly moved a little bit, and other ones were moving a great deal just over the course of one night or a few days or a week. Some of them weren't even visible anymore. Because of the Earth's rotation or something fancy like that.</p></p><p><p>So now these people take their telescopes and keep looking up and they record what they see, these dots and patterns and how they move.</p></p><p><p>Then one nice clear night someone looks up and sees not a white dot but a ball. A ball with colors and...clouds? Rings? Surface features? What the fuck are these things? Planets. Fucking planets.</p></p><p><p>It's also important to remember that back when these things were first being discovered, light polution was basically non-existent. You could see the bright bands of billions of stars of the Milky Way with your naked eyes. Today you have be in the absolute darkest parts of the world and as elevated as you can possibly be to see these things.</p></p><p><p>There was zero chance people didn't notice these things in detail with their naked eyes, which is what prompted them to look closer using the tools that they developed for other things (telescopes).</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_ipoq6of"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/CherryDudeFellaGirl">CherryDudeFellaGirl</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/xm9kun/eli5_how_did_the_people_hundreds_of_years_ago/ipoq6of/">Sat 2022-09-24 at 05:45</a> (1) <a href="#t3_xm9kun" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_ipop1ds" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_ipoqriq" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_ipoq6of" class="n S">◯</a></header><p>Haha i love light pollution so much, im so glad to be born mid into the proliferation of massive light pollution</p></div><div class="f o l1" id="t1_ipoqriq"><header><a href="https://www.reddit.com/u/miemcc">miemcc</a>, on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/xm9kun/eli5_how_did_the_people_hundreds_of_years_ago/ipoqriq/">Sat 2022-09-24 at 05:52</a> (1) <a href="#t3_xm9kun" class="n P">▣</a> <a href="#t1_ipoq6of" class="n A">🠉</a> <a href="#t1_ipp49lp" class="n B">🠋</a> <a href="#t1_ipoqriq" class="n S">◯</a></header><p>How they moved in the sky was 'odd'. Occasionally they would appear to move the 'wrong' way.</p></p><p><p>Both the Earth and the planet are orbiting the Sun.
